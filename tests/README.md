### Building PyTorch binaries for Travis CI

The Pyro development on `dev` branch may use the latest features that are not present in the 
release version of PyTorch. As such, these features need to be tested against PyTorch's master 
branch rather than the release which may be a few months older.

For this, we need to build PyTorch binaries on a need-be basis, and upload them to the S3 bucket 
`s3://pyro-ppl/ci`. We use the scripts in the [PyTorch builder](https://github.com/pytorch/builder) 
repo for this. In particular, use the following instructions for building the binaries:
 - Clone the [PyTorch builder](https://github.com/pytorch/builder) repo on your local system.
 - Under the `manywheel` directory, run a docker container:
```sh
cd manywheel
docker run -it --ipc=host --rm -v $(pwd):/remote soumith/manylinux-cuda80:latest bash
```
 - Modify the `build_cpu.sh` script as follows:
   - Remove all environment variables except for `NO_CUDA` and `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`.
   - Instead of checking out the version tag through `git checkout tags/v${PYTORCH_BUILD_VERSION}`, 
     check out the commit/branch you would like to build.
 - We need to update `cmake` to version 3 to build PyTorch master:
```sh
yum install epel-release
yum install cmake3
yum remove cmakeâ€¨
ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake
```
 - Then run, `./build_cpu.sh` under the `directory`, which will create the required binaries 
 in `/wheelhouse` directory.
 - Upload the binaries to the S3 bucket `s3://pyro-ppl/ci` with public read permissions.
